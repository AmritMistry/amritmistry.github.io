        <h3>12th January 2026</h3>
        <h1>Not so great although it was a great day</h1>
        <h2>summery</h2>
        <p>can't explain today or I must say I can't explain my life till now it was so boring and so repetative but from now I think I can make a proper shift
            is it late? yes, is it imposible now? honestely even I don't know or no body knows I want to get a job as sde and I think I should give my everything I have
            so here I am. To show up everyday from now.
        </p>
        <p>
            so who is the customer? I must say my futerself. because the current self is not depressed but he is not confident so when the future self will come back and see these he will futerself
            proud of himself that he might be late but he achived the destination or not... does it even matter(honestly yes!)
        </p>
        <h1>
            thanks to me for being positive but future self will tell that being positive was great or not....
        </h1>
